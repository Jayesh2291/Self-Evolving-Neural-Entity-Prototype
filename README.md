# Self-Evolving-Neural-Entity-Prototype
Build a modular system where a minimal neural core (the ENN) receives streaming experience, learns continuously, can evolve its topology (neuroevolution), and uses a sandboxed meta‑module to propose code changes or new network modules. Human oversight and safety controls are embedded.
